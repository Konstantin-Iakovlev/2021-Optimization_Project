  author =	"Rie Johnson and Tong Zhang",
  year = 	"2013",
  volume =	"26",
  abstract =	"Stochastic gradient descent is popular for large scale
		 optimization but has slow convergence asymptotically
		 due to the inherent variance. To remedy this problem,
		 we introduce an explicit variance reduction method for
		 stochastic gradient descent which we call stochastic
		 variance reduced gradient (SVRG). For smooth and
		 strongly convex functions, we prove that this method
		 enjoys the same fast convergence rate as those of
		 stochastic dual coordinate ascent (SDCA) and Stochastic
		 Average Gradient (SAG). However, our analysis is
		 significantly simpler and more intuitive. Moreover,
		 unlike SDCA or SAG, our method does not require the
		 storage of gradients, and thus is more easily
		 applicable to complex problems such as some structured
		 prediction problems and neural network learning.",
